I'm new to go, I've heard a lot about it, I'll document the process and keep putting small programs written in go as I progress. I'm planning to contribute to Kubernetes, since, Kubernetes is written in go, I've to learn go.

<b> Features: </b> Statically typed, compiled language

<b> My understanding of Go - A little background on my academic journey</b>
<br>
I started my freshman year at SDState in 2015, I was taught C++ and C in the first semester along with Python Informatics. Later, when I transferred to Foothill, I stayed with C++ up until last month. I also took Java 1A at Foothill but I had to drop that class since I performed terribly and didn't understand a thing. Coming from a C++ background and submitting assignments written in that language were fine. But now that I've started preparing for technical interviews since last month, Python is my preferred language for solving coding challanges. Although, I wasn't very regular with Python syntaxes, Google's secret foobar challanges made me more comfortable with them. Go seems like an interesting language. It has the best of both C++ and Python. Currently, I'm in the "hello world" stage. Although, putting the data type after declaring the variable seems kinda weird, I'm planning to learn it slowly.

<b>Simple Hello World program in go:</b>
<br>

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

  fmt.Println("Hello")

}

```
<b>Analysis of the above program,</b>
<br>
In Python, I could write this in a single line,<br>
```python
print("Hello")
```
In C++ this would be,
<br>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  cout << "Hello" << endl;

return 0;
}
```
